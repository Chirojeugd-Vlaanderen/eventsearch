# eventsearch

This CiviCRM extension contains a report template that allows more fine grained
event searches.

It allows searching on event location, or on event custom fields, which is
useful if you want to manage a whole lot of events.

If you want to use this, you need to create a report based on this template;
you'll find it in Administration, CiviCreport, New report from template. 

I created a report, and not a custom search, because I think that custom
searches are more relevant when you search for contacts. Also the filtering
that is built in the reporting interface, is very nice.

This extension is rather basic. I welcome pull requests :-)
