# eventsearch

This CiviCRM extension contains a report template that allows more fine grained
event searches.

It allows searching on event location, or on event custom fields, which is
useful if you want to manage a whole lot of events.

If you want to use this, you need to create a report based on this template;
you'll find it in Administration, CiviCreport, New report from template.
