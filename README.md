# be.chiro.civi.eventsearch

This CiviCRM extension should provide some event related report templates.
At the moment there is only one template, I plan to add more at
some point in the future.

I chose to create reports, and not custom searches, because I think that custom
searches are more relevant for searching contacts. Also the filtering
that is built in the reporting interface, is very nice.

This extension is rather basic. I welcome pull requests :-)

## Event List

This template allows searching on event location, or on event custom fields, which is
useful if you want to manage a whole lot of events.

If you want to use this, you need to create a report based on this template;
you'll find it in Administration, CiviCreport, New report from template.
